RetrasoBot is a Twitch chat bot written in Python 2.7 that sends keystrokes to a program based on commands written in the chat.

## Usage

You will need [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pywin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/) installed on your system.

Edit `Settings.py` according to your liking and needs.

**Remember to have both `RetrasoBot.py` and `Settings.py` in the same directory.**


Once finished, double click `RetrasoBot.py` or open it through the command prompt and wait until the bot gets connected.

Keep the program you want to send the keystrokes **in focus** or it **will not** work.


To shut it down you can either close the Bot window or use the `Remote Shutdown Password` if it is enabled.
